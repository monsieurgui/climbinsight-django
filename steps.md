1. Project Initialization and Infrastructure Setup

Initialize your repository, set up version control, and configure your CI/CD pipeline.
Define your tech stack, development environments (local, staging, production), and basic project structure.
Establish configuration management, logging, error tracking, and system health monitoring.

2. Base API Foundation

Create a project skeleton with a robust routing system and middleware (for error handling, security, etc.).
Set up a centralized API configuration that will allow future integration of features like rate limiting and cache management.
Lay the groundwork for automated testing (unit and integration tests).

3. Database Schema and Models

Design and implement the database schema using an ORM or direct SQL, defining tables/models for core entities such as leagues, competitions, events, gyms, and users.
Create migrations and seed data for initial testing.

4. User Management and Authentication

Build essential endpoints for user registration, login (including email/password and OAuth2 options), email verification, and password reset.
Implement session management, role-based access control (with roles like athlete, official, admin, etc.), and multi-factor authentication.
Include audit logs and active session management to support security requirements.

5. League Module – Core API Endpoints

Develop endpoints to create and manage leagues, including the management of competitions, schedules, rankings, and participating athletes/officials.
Integrate league-specific features like ranking calculation, qualification criteria, seasonal records, and governing body details (refer to the “Create a League” section in your spec).

6. Competition Module – Building on the Base API

Create endpoints to manage competitions within leagues, including event organization, venue selection, scheduling (start/end dates with times), and competition descriptions.
Ensure handling of competition-specific aspects such as technical delegate assignment, appeals committees, and safety protocols as noted in the spec.

7. Event Module – Detailed Scheduling and Management

Implement endpoints for event creation and management, ensuring that events capture start/end dates, isolation timeslots, venue details, and athlete lists.
Incorporate event-specific logic such as ruleset inheritance from competitions, starting order generation, attempt tracking, and safety procedures.

8. Gym Module – Profile and Operational Features

Build endpoints for creating and managing gym profiles (name, location, coordinates, team, etc.) and include safety certification status and equipment inspection logs.
Add endpoints for facility management, scheduling (availability calendar), and capacity tracking.

9. General Application Features and Cross-Cutting Concerns

Implement responsive design, advanced search and filtering capabilities, data backup/recovery, and comprehensive audit logs across the application.
Address performance monitoring, error logging, system status checks, and compliance with bilingual support and regulatory requirements.

10. System Administration and Compliance

Develop endpoints for system configuration management (feature flags, API configurations, environment parameters).
Integrate monitoring tools for system health, error tracking, performance metrics, and security incident reporting.
Build out compliance features to address GDPR, Quebec privacy laws, data residency, and encryption needs.

11. Testing, Documentation, and Deployment

Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and API tests) for all modules.
Create API documentation and user guides that reflect each module’s endpoints and behaviors.
Set up continuous deployment pipelines to streamline releases and monitor system health post-deployment.

12. Advanced and Optional Features (Post-MVP Enhancements)

Plan for additional features such as data import/export, notifications, analytics dashboards, and integration with external systems (scoring hardware, mapping services, etc.).
Consider AI-powered enhancements (e.g., performance forecasting, natural language processing for search) as iterative improvements after the core system is stable.
